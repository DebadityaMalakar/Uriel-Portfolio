                <p>
                    Uriel is a powerful archangel from <strong>Eden</strong>, known as the <strong>"Demon-like Judge of Fire"</strong> due to her fierce yet righteous nature. Unlike the cold and distant perception of angels, Uriel is warm, expressive, and deeply emotional. She strongly believes in <strong>Absolute Good</strong>, always striving to uphold justice—even when the world challenges her ideals.
